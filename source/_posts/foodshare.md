FOODSHARE is an app that shows users discounted menu items offered by restaurants and food truck in New York before they close.

## Problem Statement
<hr>
What can we do to reduce food waste together and have an affordable meal. Let’s face it, restaurants are getting hurt by lost of profit in food waste and foods are getting pricey dining out every year.
<br>

## Research
<hr>
I conducted 3 interviews and a questionnaire using Google Form. The questionnaire is mainly about how the participants choose a restaurant to go and how aware they are about the food waste issue in the US.

## Competitors
<hr>
#### Groupon
Groupong is an e-commerce marketplace connecting subscribers with local merchants by offering activities, travel, goods and services in discounted price. There discounted meal section attracts a lot of people who want inexpensive food.
However, Groupon has very strict condition to redeem the deal. And it doesn’t help to reduce food waste. 
<br>
#### Too Good To Go
Through the Too Good To Go app, users can order delicious food from local restaurants, cafes , bakeries and other food businesses, collect it up to an hour before closing time and enjoy takeaway food.
This app is very similar to Foodshare, but it is UK-only.
